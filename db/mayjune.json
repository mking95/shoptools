This texture variant is called, \"Basket Weave\", and features a 3D textured surface that is compatible with the basket weave textures commonly seen on Law Enforcement belts, Police duty gear and other custom leather items. This texture is not to be confused with the current Basket Weave KYDEX\u00ae sheet, which is an aftermarket basket weave texture applied to normal KYDEX\u00ae sheet stock. Unlike basket weave KYDEX\u00ae, HOLSTEX\u00ae Basket weave texture is a revolutionary step forward in the available texture options for professional sheath and holster makers. It is available in multiple thicknesses and colors, and is offered in format sizes up to 4\u2019 x 8\u2019 sheets. The 3D texture on HOLSTEX\u00ae Basket Weave is a raised surface texture and does not distort or fade with forming like the aftermarket KYDEX\u00ae basket weave texture currently on the market. HOLSTEX\u00ae basket weave forms exceptionally well at normal thermoforming temperatures (325\u00baF - 375\u00baF). It does not distort at the higher ends of the heating range, and can be easily molded using both press-form and vacuum-forming equipment."], "main_img": ["images/holstex_bskw-fde_1_800.jpg"], "main_img_width": ["800"], "main_img_height": ["600"], "images": ["images/cartlogo.gif", "images/holstex_bskw-fde_1_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-fde_1_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-fde_2_800.jpg", "images/bw_samples_fde_1_800.jpg", "images/bw_samples_fde_2_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_3_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_4_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_5_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_6_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_7_800.jpg", "holstex_bskw-bk_7_800.jpg", "../vcom/images/graphics/pricematch.jpg", "../vcom/images/graphics/facebook/knifekits_fb.gif", "images/social_bookmarks/email.png", "images/social_bookmarks/facebook.png", "images/social_bookmarks/twitter.png", "//assets.pinterest.com/images/PinExt.png", "images/social_bookmarks/digg.png", "images/coco_0620-31_1_150.jpg", "images/oab_mp-940_1_150.jpg", "../vcom/images/graphics/subscribe_box.gif", "images/footerlogo.gif"], "title": ["HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Flat Dark Earth) - (.125) - (8in x 12in) | KnifeKits.com"], "name": ["Catalog", "Holster Making - Materials", "HOLSTEX\u00ae", "Flat Dark Earth", "HLX-SHE125-BSKT-FDE-812", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Flat Dark Earth) - (.125) - (8in x 12in)", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Flat Dark Earth) - (.125) - (8in x 12in)"], "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "\n", "Catalog", "\n", "Holster Making - Materials", "\n", "HOLSTEX\u00ae", "\n", "Flat Dark Earth", "\n", "HLX-SHE125-BSKT-FDE-812", "\n"], "url": ["https://www.knifekits.com/vcom/holstex-diy-thermoform-sheet-basket-weavesmooth-flat-dark-earth-125-8in-12in-p-16423.html"], "link_rel": ["https://www.knifekits.com/vcom/images/holstex_bskw-fde_1_150.jpg?osCsid=k2kslt4gcj818q4nib2hpnofa6"], "listing_page": ["https://www.knifekits.com/vcom/holstex-flat-dark-earth-c-838.html?osCsid=k2kslt4gcj818q4nib2hpnofa6"], "price": ["9.16"]},

It does not distort at the higher ends of the heating range, and can be easily molded using both press-form and vacuum-forming equipment."], "main_img": ["images/holstex_bskw-bk_1_800.jpg"], "main_img_width": ["800"], "main_img_height": ["600"], "images": ["images/cartlogo.gif", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_1_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_1_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_2_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_3_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_4_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_5_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_6_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_7_800.jpg", "holstex_bskw-bk_7_800.jpg", "images/awl_bldwd-scl-616_1_150.jpg", "images/bladebond_ultra_8oz_1_150.jpg", "images/flush-clip_metal_150_1_150.jpg", "images/sheathclip_bk_1_150.jpg", "images/sheathclip2_bk_1_150.jpg", "images/shclp-m5-3h-micro_1_150.jpg", "../vcom/images/graphics/pricematch.jpg", "../vcom/images/graphics/facebook/knifekits_fb.gif", "images/social_bookmarks/email.png", "images/social_bookmarks/facebook.png", "images/social_bookmarks/twitter.png", "//assets.pinterest.com/images/PinExt.png", "images/social_bookmarks/digg.png", "images/bg_fsg17g4_x300_1_150.jpg", "images/owb_sig-p229r_1_150.jpg", "../vcom/images/graphics/subscribe_box.gif", "images/footerlogo.gif"], "title": ["HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Armor Black) - (.080) - (8in x 8in) | KnifeKits.com"], "name": ["Catalog", "Holster Making - Materials", "HOLSTEX\u00ae", "Black", "HLX-SHE08-BSKT-BLK-88", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Armor Black) - (.080) - (8in x 8in)", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Armor Black) - (.080) - (8in x 8in)", "Bloodwood - Handle Scales - Stabilized - (6 x 1.50 x .250)", "BladeBond - Premium Epoxy Adhesive - (2-part) - Ultra - (8oz)", "Belt Clip - Universal Sheath/Holster - Flush Mount w/holes - (Metal) - 1.50", "Belt Clip - Universal Sheath/Holster - Model 1 - Black - (Tactical Finish)", "Belt Clip - Universal Sheath/Holster - Model 2 - Black - (Tactical Finish)", "Belt Clip - Universal Sheath/Holster - Model 5 - 3-Hole - Black (Tactical Finish)"], "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "\n", "Catalog", "\n", "Holster Making - Materials", "\n", "HOLSTEX\u00ae", "\n", "Black", "\n", "HLX-SHE08-BSKT-BLK-88", "\n"], "url": ["https://www.knifekits.com/vcom/holstex-diy-thermoform-sheet-basket-weavesmooth-armor-black-080-8in-8in-p-16092.html"], "link_rel": ["https://www.knifekits.com/vcom/images/holstex_bskw-bk_1_150.jpg"], "listing_page": ["https://www.knifekits.com/vcom/holstex-black-c-832.html"], "price": ["4.36", "$24.95", "$24.99", "$2.99", "$0.75", "$1.85", "$1.55"]},

It does not distort at the higher ends of the heating range, and can be easily molded using both press-form and vacuum-forming equipment."], "main_img": ["images/holstex_bskw-bs_1_800.jpg"], "main_img_width": ["800"], "main_img_height": ["600"], "images": ["images/cartlogo.gif", "images/holstex_bskw-bs_1_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bs_1_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bs_2_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_3_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_4_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_5_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_6_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-bk_7_800.jpg", "holstex_bskw-bk_7_800.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-pb_1_150.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-ph_1_150.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-stmgy_1_150.jpg", "images/holstex_bskw-zg_1_150.jpg", "images/kysh_fde-spring_1_150.jpg", "images/kyshg_150.jpg", "../vcom/images/graphics/pricematch.jpg", "../vcom/images/graphics/facebook/knifekits_fb.gif", "images/social_bookmarks/email.png", "images/social_bookmarks/facebook.png", "images/social_bookmarks/twitter.png", "//assets.pinterest.com/images/PinExt.png", "images/social_bookmarks/digg.png", "images/coco_0620-31_1_150.jpg", "images/me300-b-1-150.jpg", "../vcom/images/graphics/subscribe_box.gif", "images/footerlogo.gif"], "title": ["HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Battleship Gray) - (.080) - (8in x 8in) | KnifeKits.com"], "name": ["Catalog", "Holster Making - Materials", "HOLSTEX\u00ae", "Battleship Gray", "HLX-SHE08-BSKT-BTLSHP-88", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Battleship Gray) - (.080) - (8in x 8in)", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Battleship Gray) - (.080) - (8in x 8in)", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Police Blue) - (.080) - (8in x 8in)", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Purple Haze) - (.080) - (8in x 8in)", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Storm Gray) - (.080) - (8in x 8in)", "HOLSTEX\u2122 - DIY Thermoform Sheet  - Basket Weave/Smooth - (Zombie Green) - (.080) - (8in x 8in)", "KYDEX\u2122 Sheet - Flat Dark Earth - Spring - (.060) - (2ft x 4ft)", "KYDEX\u2122 Sheet - Gunmetal Gray - (.060) - (2ft x 4ft)"], "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "\n", "Catalog", "\n", "Holster Making - Materials", "\n", "HOLSTEX\u00ae", "\n", "Battleship Gray", "\n", "HLX-SHE08-BSKT-BTLSHP-88", "\n"], "url": ["https://www.knifekits.com/vcom/holstex-diy-thermoform-sheet-basket-weavesmooth-battleship-gray-080-8in-8in-p-16265.html"], "link_rel": ["https://www.knifekits.com/vcom/images/holstex_bskw-bs_1_150.jpg"], "listing_page": ["https://www.knifekits.com/vcom/holstex-battleship-gray-c-833.html"], "price": ["4.36", "$4.36", "$4.36", "$4.36", "$4.36", "$27.45", "$27.45"]},
